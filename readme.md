### Features to add

I want to focus on other projects now, so I'm leaving this one, but it can be expanded, e.g. by:

- deposit/withdraw 
- support 
- small code changes to make it more efficient (removing redundancy)
- better css ( i dont have time to make it perfect )

Maybe I'll add it in some time
